I wanted to try Puppet Enterprise but didn't really want to install it on my system, so 
I created a [script to create a Puppet Enterprise Docker Image](https://github.com/jefferyb/puppet-enterprise-in-docker) for me.

## How to use it

In short:

- Download "puppet-enterprise-2016.4.0-ubuntu-14.04-amd64.tar.gz" from [PuppetLabs](https://puppet.com/download-puppet-enterprise).
- Clone my [Puppet Enterprise Scripts](https://github.com/jefferyb/puppet-enterprise-in-docker.git) repo
- Make sure that the `puppet-enterprise-2016.4.0-ubuntu-14.04-amd64.tar.gz` file is in the cloned repo, `puppet-enterprise-in-docker`, or that you have the download link variable, `PE_DOWNLOAD_LINK`, set in `install-puppet-in-docker` file
- Edit the variables section, such as `IMAGE_NAME`, `PUPPET_MASTER_HOSTNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` at the top of `create-a-puppet-enterprise-docker-image` and `install-puppet-in-docker` files to suite you
- Run the `create-a-puppet-enterprise-docker-image` script

#### Bash

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jefferyb/puppet-enterprise-in-docker.git
$ mv puppet-enterprise-2016.4.0-ubuntu-14.04-amd64.tar.gz puppet-enterprise-in-docker
$ cd puppet-enterprise-in-docker
$ ./create-a-puppet-enterprise-docker-image
```

If all goes well, it should launch an instance and if you run `docker ps`, you should see a running container, `test-puppet-enterprise` with autosign turned on. 
You can then run:

```bash
$ docker run --rm --link test-puppet-enterprise:puppet puppet/puppet-agent-alpine
```

and you should see something like:

```bash

```

You can then access Puppet Enterprise at:

- https://puppet.example.com or whatever you set `PUPPET_MASTER_HOSTNAME` or the hostname of the machine you're running docker on and the port number mapped to 443
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `welcometopuppet` or which ever one that you set at `ADMIN_PASSWORD`

## The long version:

### Requirements

I used the [Ubuntu 14.04](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu/) image to install, but to successfully install Puppet Enterprise, you'll need to:

##### 1. - Set the `locale`

You can check by running `locale`

```bash
root@0fb9e6958e1c:~# locale
LANG=
LANGUAGE=
LC_CTYPE="POSIX"
LC_NUMERIC="POSIX"
LC_TIME="POSIX"
LC_COLLATE="POSIX"
LC_MONETARY="POSIX"
LC_MESSAGES="POSIX"
LC_PAPER="POSIX"
LC_NAME="POSIX"
LC_ADDRESS="POSIX"
LC_TELEPHONE="POSIX"
LC_MEASUREMENT="POSIX"
LC_IDENTIFICATION="POSIX"
LC_ALL=
```

To set `locale` in the Dockerfile, do:

```bash
RUN locale-gen en_US.UTF-8  
ENV LANG en_US.UTF-8  
ENV LANGUAGE en_US:en  
ENV LC_ALL en_US.UTF-8 
```

or run:

```bash
root@0fb9e6958e1c:~# locale-gen en_US.UTF-8
Generating locales...
  en_US.UTF-8... done
Generation complete.
root@0fb9e6958e1c:~# export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
root@0fb9e6958e1c:~# export LANGUAGE=en_US.UTF-8
root@0fb9e6958e1c:~# export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
```

You can test it or check it again, and you should have something like this:

```bash
root@0fb9e6958e1c:~# locale
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
LANGUAGE=en_US.UTF-8
LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_TIME="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_COLLATE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MONETARY="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MESSAGES="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_PAPER="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_NAME="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_ADDRESS="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_TELEPHONE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MEASUREMENT="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
```

##### 2. - Download Puppet Enterprise

You can download the tarball for the current version of Puppet Enterprise at [https://puppet.com/download-puppet-enterprise](https://puppet.com/download-puppet-enterprise).
Unpack the tarball by running `tar -xf <TARBALL_FILENAME>`

##### 3. - Create a pe.conf file

Puppet Enterprise uses a pe.conf file to install in Text-mode installation

```bash
cat > pe.conf <<'PECONF'
{
  "console_admin_password": "ADMIN_PASSWORD",
  "puppet_enterprise::puppet_master_host": "PUPPET_MASTER_HOSTNAME",
  "pe_install::puppet_master_dnsaltnames": [
    "puppet"
  ]
}
PECONF
```

where `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is the password for the `admin` user,
and `PUPPET_MASTER_HOSTNAME` is the hostname you want to use, like puppet.example.com or you can use `"%{::trusted.certname}"` for its FQDN.

### Install Puppet Enterprise

To install PE, cd into the unpacked folder and run:

```bash
./puppet-enterprise-installer -c <FULL PATH TO pe.conf>
```

To complete the setup of the system, run:

```bash
puppet agent -t
```

Once it's done, you can point your browser to **https**://YOUR_HOSTNAME and login with **admin** and whatever you set **ADMIN_PASSWORD** to...
